/*
 Write a program that defines a shape class with a constructor that gives value to width and height. 
Then define two sub-classes, triangle and rectangle, that calculate the area of the shape area. 
Test the two sub-classes by defining two variables, a triangle and a rectangle, and then call the area function for these two variables.
